{:.intro}
I am a postdoc at the University of Houston (Texas, USA) since November 2019. 
There, I work mostly with Gopal Pandurangan.

{:.intro}
My research interests mostly lie in the field of distributed computing. However, theoretical computer science research in general also interests me. 
In more depth, my research can be separated into three major research directions. 
The first direction considers weak models of distributed computing. The goal is to understand the fundamental limits of such models (e.g., the beeping model and amoebot models) compared to the more commonly-used ones. 
The absence of such limits indicates that we can use devices with weaker capabilities---and thus cheaper devices---without incurring any significant costs.
The second direction is to develop an energy-centric complexity theory of distributed computing which would parallel the current time-centric distributed complexity theory. For a handful of problems, we now know that giving nodes the capability to "sleep" allows for an exponential improvement in the energy cost of distributed algorithms. 
Do all distributed problems similarly allow for such an exponential improvement? Is an exponential improvement the best we can hope for? 
The third direction looks at energy-efficient distributed algorithms from the viewpoint of messages. Can we design singularly optimal algorithms, that is, that are both fast and send few messages? Or are there inherent tradeoffs? 
What about in highly dynamic environments, such as peer-to-peer networks? Can we design singularly optimal algorithms that are also tolerant to adversarial (byzantine) faults?
