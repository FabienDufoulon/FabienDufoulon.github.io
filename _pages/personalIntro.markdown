{:.intro}
I am a postdoc at the University of Houston (Texas, USA) since November 2019. 
There, I work mostly with Gopal Pandurangan.

{:.intro}
My research interest, broadly construed, is distributed computing. More precisely, my focus is on weak models of distributed computing, energy-efficient distributed computing and protocols for highly dynamic environment such as peer-to-peer networks, including protocols with tolerance to adversarial (byzantine) faults.
