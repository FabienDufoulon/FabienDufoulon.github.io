{:.intro}
I am a lecturer at Lancaster University (UK). The position is roughly equivalent to an assistant professorship (US) and to Maître de Conférences (FR).

{:.intro}
My research interests lie in the areas of algorithms (with a focus on graph algorithms) and distributed computing. In particular, I have two major research directions within distributed computing. The first is the study and design of frugal algorithms, or in other words, algorithms that use less messages, less energy, less memory, weaker communication mechanisms, etc., and finding out when this must come at the cost of the algorithm's runtime. The second is the exploration of quantum advantages in quantum distributed networks (i.e., with quantum computation and communication), especially in term of communication costs, runtime, or even both simultaneously.

{:.intro}
Distributed networks play a fundamental role in numerous modern computer science applications. Among these, I am particularly interested in quantum distributed computing, green computing (or sustainable computing), secure peer-to-peer networks (with applications to blockchains), swarm robotics, and wireless networks.
