I am a postdoc at the University of Houston (Texas, USA) where I work mostly with Gopal Pandurangan. During my previous postdoc (Technion, Israel), I have had the pleasure to work with Shay Kutten, Yuval Emek and Keren Censor-Hillel. 
Before that, I received my Ph.D. in 2019 from the Universit√© Paris-Saclay with Joffroy Beauquier and Janna Burman as my advisors.
