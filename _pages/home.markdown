I am a postdoc at the Technion in Israel. I currently study *biologically-inspired distributed systems* for *programmable matter*. 
When talking about programmable matter, one imagines numerous tiny robots coming together to form whatever object is needed at the moment. 
These robots can both sense and affect their environment but, for scalability reasons, are extremely weak in memory, mobility and communication.
Surprisingly, despite this, they can coordinate together to achieve complex global tasks such as shape formation, self-healing, dispersion, aggregation and monitoring. <br>
During this postdoc, I have had the pleasure to work with Shay Kutten, Yuval Emek and Keren Censor-Hillel.

Before that, I graduated in 2016 from Centrale Supélec, one of the top French "grandes écoles". 
After which, I received my Ph.D. in 2019 from the Université Paris-Saclay with Joffroy Beauquier and Janna Burman as my advisers.

## Research Focus
Distributed systems of weak devices are currently my main research focus. Happily for me, the study of such systems greatly intersects with that of biologically-inspired distributed algorithms, one of my childhood fascinations.

My goal is (1) to *design efficient solutions* suited to distributed systems of weak devices and (2) to better understand how such devices' weak capabilities (e.g. weak communication, limited memory or limited mobility) affect the *achievability and efficiency of distributed algorithms* 
in order to (3) better inform on the *devices versus algorithms tradeoffs*. Indeed, on the one hand, weaker electronic devices are much cheaper which in turn enables cheaper or larger distributed systems. 
On the other hand, if the devices become too weak, algorithms can become (provably) less efficient, and maybe even impossible to design.
