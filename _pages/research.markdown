My research focuses on distributed computing problems. In particular, I work on clock synchronization, graph problems (coloring, maximal independent set), communication primitives and leader election. Other interests include, but are not limited to, self-stabilization algorithms (and more generally fault-tolerance), approximation algorithms and coding theory. Although my current research leans more towards the deterministic approach, randomization is a strong tool when the memory size of devices is extremely limited or when devices are uncoordinated. Randomization can also contribute to a better understanding of the biological systems around us.

I am fascinated by distributed and biological computing, as well as nanoscale distributed systems. In both cases, limited memory and/or communication greatly impact the design of efficient distributed algorithms.
