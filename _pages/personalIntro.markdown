{:.intro}
I am a lecturer at Lancaster University (UK). 

{:.intro}
My research interests lie in the areas of algorithms (with a focus on graph algorithms) and distributed computing. In particular, I am interested in designing frugal algorithms, or in other words, algorithms that use less messages, less energy, less memory, weaker communication mechanisms, etc., and finding out when this must come at the cost of the algorithm's runtime. 

Distributed networks play a fundamental role in numerous modern computer science applications. Among these, I am particularly interested in secure peer-to-peer networks (with applications to blockchains), green computing (or sustainable computing), swarm robotics, and wireless networks.
