* Four of my papers will be part of the PODC 2025 program:
   - "Quantum Communication Advantage for Leader Election and Agreement"
   - "Message Optimality and Message-Time Trade-offs for APSP and Beyond"
   - "Improved Byzantine Agreement under an Adaptive Adversary"
   - "Energy-Efficient Maximal Independent Sets in Radio Networks" (as a brief announcement) 
* We recently submitted "Quantum Communication Advantage for Leader Election and Agreement" (joint work with Frédéric Magniez and Gopal Pandurangan). This work provides a new framework for quantum distributed networks, in which one can design more frugal (in terms of message sent) quantum distributed algorithms.
