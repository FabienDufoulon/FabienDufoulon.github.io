I received my Ph.D. from the Universit√© Paris-Saclay, supervised by Joffroy Beauquier and Janna Burman. During it, I studied *distributed systems of weak devices* (with regards to communication).   

Following which, I started a postdoc at the Technion in Israel with a focus on biologically-inspired distributed systems: *programmable matter*. 
In these systems, extremely weak devices (in memory, mobility and communication) coordinate together to achieve complex global tasks such as monitoring, dispersion, aggregation, shape formation and self-healing. <br>
During this postdoc, I have had the pleasure to work with Shay Kutten, Yuval Emek and Keren Censor-Hillel.


## Research Focus
Distributed system of weak devices are currently my main research focus. Happily for me, the study of such systems greatly intersects with that of biologically-inspired distributed algorithms, one of my childhood fascinations.

My goal is (1) to *design efficient solutions* suited to distributed systems of weak devices and (2) to better understand how such devices' weak capabilities (e.g. weak communication, limited memory or limited mobility) affect the *achievability and efficiency of distributed algorithms* 
in order to (3) better inform on the *devices versus algorithms tradeoffs*. Indeed, on the one hand, weaker electronic devices are much cheaper which in turn enables cheaper or larger distributed systems. 
On the other hand, if the devices become too weak, algorithms can become (provably) less efficient, and maybe even impossible to design.
