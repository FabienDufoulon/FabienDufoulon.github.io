{:.intro}
I am a lecturer (equiv. to assistant professor) at Lancaster University (UK). 

{:.intro}
My research interests lie in the areas of algorithms and distributed computing. Distributed networks play a fundamental role in modern computer science applications. Among these, I am particularly interested in secure peer-to-peer networks (with applications to blockchains), green computing (or sustainable computing), swarm robotics, and wireless networks.
