{:.intro}
I am a postdoc at the University of Houston (Texas, USA) since November 2019. 
There, I work mostly with Gopal Pandurangan.

{:.intro}
My research interests lie in distributed computing and more widely, in theoretical computer science. 
In more depth, my research can be separated into three major research directions. The first is to understand the fundamental limits of distributed computing with weak but cheap devices (e.g., the beeping model and amoebot models). 
The second direction is to develop an energy-centric distributed complexity theory so that we can understand distributed computing beyond the current time-centric view. 
The third direction is to design message-efficient distributed algorithms that remain fast, both in static and dynamic networks. For the latter part, the focus is on designing distributed algorithms that tolerant to adversarial (byzantine) faults and apply to peer-to-peer networks.
