## Beginnings

I was introduced to academia by Joanna Tomasik and Johanne Cohen of the Laboratoire Interdisciplinaire des Sciences du Numérique (LISN) of the Université Paris-Saclay. 
My very first research (school) project with Joanna Tomasik was about studying quantum simulated annealing as well as its possible improvements over classical simulated annealing.
My second project, during a summer internship with Johanne Cohen, was on the other hand focused on the application of game theory to online agents. 



## Ph.D. in France

Following which, my interest turned towards distributed computing. Thus, I started my Ph.D. in 2016 with Joffroy Beauquier and Janna Burman in the Parallel Systems team of the LISN. 
Three years later, I received my Ph.D. from the Université Paris-Saclay.
During this period, I worked on the design of efficient deterministic algorithms for distributed systems of weak devices. Here, weak is meant in the sense of severely limited communication capabilities. 
Such restrictions come naturally when dealing with very cheap sensors, animals with basic communication (e.g., fireflies) or biological cells communicating via proteins. 

More formally, the distributed system is modelled as a graph-based network of devices, called nodes, that communicate using bursts of energy (i.e., *beeps*) and simple detection (of energy) only. 
When multiple nodes beep simultaneously (i.e., in the same round), listening nodes detect only a beep. 
In other words, they do not learn any information on the senders, nor the number of beeps transmitted.
This *beeping model* was recently introduced in the distributed computing community. 
The poor expressiveness of communication in this model raises a new set of issues, not typically considered in distributed computing. 
Dealing with these issues in a deterministic manner was the main goal of my Ph.D. 


## Postdoc in Israel

In November 2019, I started a postdoc at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. During the first year, I was working with Shay Kutten and Yuval Emek on biologically-inspired distributed systems. 
In particular, with Shay Kutten and Billy Moses Jr. (a fellow postdoc), we designed an extremely efficient deterministic leader election algorithm for a well-studied formal model of programmable matter. 
This *amoebot model* represents distributed systems of nano-robots (modelled as limited memory agents with poor mobility and weak communication capabilities) coordinating together to achieve tasks such as monitoring, dispersion and self-healing. 

Currently, I am working with Shay Kutten and Keren Censor-Hillel on the impact of limited communication in distributed systems.
