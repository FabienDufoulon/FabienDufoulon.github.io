I am also greatly interested in biological distributed algorithms, and biological distributed computing in general. 
For more information on the subject, you can look at the BDA workshops [(BDA 2021)](https://www.navlakhalab.net/BDA/2021/) and the CELLS workshops [(CELLS 2022)](https://parsys.lri.fr/CELLS/).

During my (previous) postdoc at the Technion in Israel, I have had the pleasure to work with Shay Kutten, Yuval Emek and Keren Censor-Hillel. 
Before that, I received my Ph.D. in 2019 from the Universit√© Paris-Saclay with Joffroy Beauquier and Janna Burman as my advisors.
